Looks like we're not updating pass every redist()
I'm pretty sure that's relevant

nvm proc.c 419

it looks like pass is being updated by the value of stride in 
it's own process. Should that be the case??

Reading 2.3 3rd bullet it looks like that shouldn't be the case
but then looking at the diagram it looks like it should...

Probably should make sure all of the math is right for the eqs
and build out from there i.e. vvv

- ticket_p = [STRIDE_TOTAL_TICKETS/N]
- stride_p = [(STRIDE_TOTAL_TICKETS * 10)/ ticket_p]
- pass_p = pass_p + stride_p


Commenting code:
- Should running processes also qualify to be rescheduled?? -> proc.c 391
- Make sure it runs through the if statement on 394 on 394 on first run -> proc.c 394
- Check if 404 needs parenthesis -> proc.c 404
- What does ran do -> proc.c 413-416
- What does switchuvm() do -> proc.c 421
- What does switchkvm() do -> proc.c 425
- This section looks interestingl -> proc.c 736
